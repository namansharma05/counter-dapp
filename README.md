# Solana Counter dApp

This is a simple dApp for learning purpose only 📙, where I have tried to simulate a functions like Initialize counter, Increment counter, Decrement counter, Closing counter.

## Prerequisite

1. You must have installed https://phantom.com/ or any other solana wallet extension.
2. Need to run a solana cluster on your system using `solana-test-validator` in the terminal.
3. you must have some SOL in your wallet address. You can get some by running `solana airdrop 3 <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>`.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/namansharma05/counter-dapp.git

  OR

  git clone git@github.com:namansharma05/counter-dapp.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd counter-dapp
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

## Enjoy 😊
